# Solar Panel Defect Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Description
This repository demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect defects in solar panels. Ensuring the reliability and efficiency of solar panels is crucial for maintaining sustainable energy systems. The project leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to identify common issues such as cracks, dirt accumulation, and discoloration on solar panel surfaces.

## Features
- Image-Based Detection: Analyze solar panel images for defects using CNNs.
- Classification: Automatically classify images as "Defective" or "Non-Defective".
- Data Augmentation: Improve model robustness with techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling.
- Transfer Learning: Utilize pre-trained models for enhanced performance on small datasets.

## Repository Contents
1. Dataset: A collection of solar panel images with labels indicating defect presence.
2. Code: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Models: Implementation of custom CNNs and transfer learning using models like ResNet, VGG16, etc.
4. Results: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualizations for the defect detection model.

## How It Works
1. Preprocessing: Resize and normalize solar panel images, and apply data augmentation to increase diversity.
2. CNN Architecture: Use convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.
3. Model Training: Train the CNN on labeled datasets of solar panel images.
4. Evaluation: Test the trained model on unseen images to evaluate accuracy and performance.
